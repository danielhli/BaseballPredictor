# Baseball Predictor

This project predicts a baseball pitcher's win percentage based off of 
a variety of pitching statistics such as runs, strikeouts, and hits.

The dataset used is from Kaggle and contains data from the KBO throughout
the years of 1982-2021. 

This projects uses a combination of data cleaning, data visualization, and
decision trees from the scikit-learn, matplotlib, and pandas libraries. 

Inspiration for this project comes from a deep interest in baseball analytics
and the ability to analyze the game in depth.
